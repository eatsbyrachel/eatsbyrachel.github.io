This recipe literally broke TikTok when it first went viral and it's STILL making the rounds. I've made it probably ten times now so here's my definitive take.

## The Recipe

If you somehow haven't seen it: you put a block of feta in a baking dish, surround it with cherry tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, season, and bake until everything is roasted and bubbly. Then you toss it with pasta. That's it.

## What I Love

The simplicity is unmatched. On days when I don't feel like cooking, this is my go-to. The roasted tomatoes get all sweet and caramelized and when you mix them with the melty feta it creates this incredible creamy sauce without any actual cream.

## My Tips

Here's what I've learned after making this so many times:
- **Use good feta.** I'm talking the block that comes in brine, not the pre-crumbled stuff. It makes a huge difference.
- **Season aggressively.** The original recipe is a little bland if you just use salt and pepper. I add garlic, red pepper flakes, and fresh basil.
- **Save pasta water.** A splash of starchy pasta water helps everything come together into a smooth sauce.

## The Verdict

Is it the best pasta I've ever had? No. Is it the best effort-to-taste ratio of any meal I've ever made? Absolutely yes. This is comfort food at its finest and I totally get why it went viral.
