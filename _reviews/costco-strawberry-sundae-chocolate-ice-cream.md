Costco recently introduced chocolate ice cream to their food court menu, and that ALSO means the strawberry sundae gets a little upgrade too! This Strawberry Sundae with Chocolate Ice Cream tastes similar to chocolate covered strawberries and I am here for it. Plus, the sundae costs $2.49 for a huge amount of ice cream swirled with strawberry topping.
