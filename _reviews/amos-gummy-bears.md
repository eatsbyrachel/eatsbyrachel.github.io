Okay so these gummy bears have been ALL over my FYP and I finally caved and ordered them. Let me tell you — they are so worth it.

## First Impressions

The packaging is cute and the bears themselves are literally the most adorable gummy candy I've ever seen. They're 3D shaped like little teddy bears and they have this soft, squishy texture that's completely different from regular gummy bears.

## Taste Test

Each bear has a juicy, fruity center that bursts when you bite into it. The flavors are strawberry, grape, peach, and mango and they all taste surprisingly natural. My favorite is the peach — it tastes like actual peach juice.

## The Verdict

These are definitely a tier above your regular Haribo bears. The texture alone sets them apart. They're soft, chewy, and juicy all at the same time. Yes they're a bit more expensive, but honestly for a treat-yourself snack? Totally worth it.

Would I repurchase? Absolutely. Already on my third bag.
