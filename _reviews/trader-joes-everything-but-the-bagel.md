If there's one Trader Joe's product that deserves all the hype it gets, it's this one. Everything But The Bagel Seasoning is a desert island pantry item for me.

## What's In It

It's a blend of sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried garlic, dried onion, and sea salt flakes. Simple ingredients but the ratio is just *chef's kiss*.

## How I Use It

The real question is how do I NOT use it. Here's my running list:
- **Avocado toast** — this is the classic combo and it's classic for a reason
- **Scrambled eggs** — game changer, trust me
- **Cream cheese bagels** — obviously
- **Roasted vegetables** — especially potatoes and broccoli
- **Salad** — sprinkle it on top for instant crunch and flavor
- **Chicken** — mix it with olive oil as a quick marinade

## The Verdict

At $2.49 this is genuinely one of the best purchases you can make at Trader Joe's. It makes boring food interesting and good food even better. I always have at least two jars in my pantry because running out is not an option.

This is a permanent 5/5 in my book. If you haven't tried it yet, what are you even doing?
