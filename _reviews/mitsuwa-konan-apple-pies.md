When I walked into Mitsuwa Marketplace and caught a whiff of these special apple pies, I immediately knew I had to try them. These are the Konan apple pies with unique flavors like chocolate and sweet potato, all baked fresh in store. The aroma alone is seriously irresistible. I tried all 3 flavors so you know exactly which one is worth getting.
