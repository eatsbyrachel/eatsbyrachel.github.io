What if the viral shio pan (salt bread) and a bagel had a baby? Well, this carb creation was cooked up by Bloom Bagels in the Bay Area. It tastes like a cross between a pretzel and a buttery croissant and I'm fully obsessed! Drop by for the bagels, but don't forget to grab a matcha or hojicha latte on your way out!
