  - "1 large ripe avocado"
  - "1 tablespoon lemon juice"

  - "Hot honey or regular honey (optional)"
  - "Fresh microgreens or arugula (optional)"
instructions:
  - "Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the water and cook for exactly 6.5 minutes for a jammy yolk."
  - "Transfer eggs to an ice bath for 2 minutes, then peel carefully."
  - "While eggs cook, toast your sourdough until golden and crispy."
  - "Halve the avocado, remove the pit, and scoop into a bowl. Add lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Mash with a fork to your desired consistency."
  - "Spread mashed avocado generously on each slice of toast."
  - "Slice the soft-boiled eggs in half and place on top of the avocado."
  - "Sprinkle with everything bagel seasoning, red pepper flakes, and flaky sea salt."
  - "Drizzle with hot honey if using, and top with microgreens."
notes: >-
  For a perfect jammy egg, timing is everything. 6.5 minutes gives you a
  slightly runny, jammy yolk. Go for 7 minutes if you prefer it more set.
  Make sure your water is at a full boil before adding the eggs.

I know, I know — "another avocado toast recipe." But hear me out. This version is *different*. The combination of the jammy soft-boiled egg, everything bagel seasoning, and that drizzle of hot honey takes it from basic to absolutely crave-worthy.

This is my most-requested recipe on TikTok and honestly, I make it for myself at least twice a week. It's the perfect quick breakfast that feels special.
