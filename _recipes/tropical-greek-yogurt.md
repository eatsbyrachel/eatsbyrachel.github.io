ingredients:
  - "2 containers Fage Total 5% Greek yogurt (32 oz)"
  - "1-2 tsp ube flavoring"
  - "1/3 cup mango puree"
  - "1/4 cup sweetened condensed coconut milk"
instructions:
  - "Split yogurt evenly into 3 bowls."
  - "In one bowl, add 1-2 tsp of ube flavoring and fold together with yogurt. Add more if you like a strong ube flavor!"
  - "In another bowl, add mango puree and fold together with yogurt."
  - "In the last bowl, add condensed coconut milk and fold together with yogurt."
  - "Add 3 even layers of each yogurt flavor into your yogurt strainer."
  - "Strain for 48 hours to ensure the moisture from the puree is removed."
  - "Dig in and enjoy!"
notes: >-
  The 48-hour strain time is important — the mango puree adds extra moisture
  that needs to be removed for the best thick, creamy texture. You can adjust
  the ube flavoring to taste.
