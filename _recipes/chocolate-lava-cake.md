servings: 4
difficulty: medium
ingredients:
  - "4 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped"
  - "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter"
  - "1 cup powdered sugar"
  - "2 large eggs"
  - "2 large egg yolks"
  - "6 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "Pinch of salt"
  - "Butter and cocoa powder for ramekins"
  - "Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream for serving"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter four 6-oz ramekins and dust with cocoa powder. Place on a baking sheet."
  - "Melt chocolate and butter together in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until smooth."
  - "Stir in powdered sugar until well combined."
  - "Whisk in eggs and egg yolks, then add vanilla extract."
  - "Fold in flour and salt until just combined. Do not overmix."
  - "Divide batter evenly among the prepared ramekins."
  - "Bake for exactly 12-14 minutes. The edges should be firm but the center will be soft."
  - "Let cool for 1 minute, then run a knife around the edges. Invert onto plates."
  - "Serve immediately with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream."
notes: >-
  The key to perfect lava cakes is timing — every oven is different, so start
  checking at 12 minutes. The center should jiggle slightly when you gently
  shake the ramekin. You can prepare the batter up to 24 hours ahead and
  refrigerate in the ramekins. Add 1-2 minutes to baking time if going
  straight from the fridge.
