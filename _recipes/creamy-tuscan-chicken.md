This Creamy Tuscan Chicken is one of my absolute go-to recipes when I want something that feels fancy but is incredibly simple to make. The combination of sun-dried tomatoes, fresh spinach, and that creamy Parmesan sauce is just *chef's kiss*.

I love serving this over a bed of angel hair pasta, but it's equally amazing with some crusty sourdough bread for dipping into all that delicious sauce.
