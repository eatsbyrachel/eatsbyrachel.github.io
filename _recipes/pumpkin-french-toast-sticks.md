servings: 4
difficulty: easy
ingredients:
  - "1 loaf Pumpkin Brioche Twist (Trader Joe's)"
  - "1qt Pumpkin Ice Cream (Trader Joe's)"
  - "Drizzle of maple syrup (optional)"
  - "Sprinkle of powdered sugar (optional)"
  - "1 tbsp crushed walnuts (optional)"
instructions:
  - "Melt the pumpkin ice cream. This can be done overnight in the fridge or in the microwave on defrost."
  - "Slice brioche into thick strips (about 3 strips per slice)."
  - "Dip quickly in melted ice cream. Don't let it soak too long!"
  - "Melt butter in a pan."
  - "Brown all sides of the French toast sticks until golden."

notes: >-
  The key is to dip quickly — if the bread soaks too long in the melted ice cream, it becomes too soggy to flip.
