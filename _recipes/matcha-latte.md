  For an iced matcha latte, follow the first two steps. Then, fill a glass

  to taste and stir well.

There's something so calming about starting the day with a warm, creamy matcha latte. It feels like a little ritual. Forget the expensive coffee shop versions — making it at home is incredibly easy and so much better.

This recipe gives you that perfect balance of earthy matcha and creamy milk. It's my go-to for a gentle caffeine boost without the jitters.
